This app requires that you have npm (v. 6.14.5+), ruby (v. 2.7.0+), and bundler (v. 2.1.4+) installed.

To run this app, in order:

1. git clone this repository, as well as the frontend at https://github.com/unclezap/frontendsports2020/
2. Install your ruby gems by running $ bundle install from the backend directory.
2. Start your backend database by running $ postgres -D [filepath to your postgres*]
3. Create your postgres database by running $ rails db:migrate and $ rails db:create from the backend directory.
3. Start your backend server by running $ rails s in the console from the backend directory.
4. Start your frontend by running npm start in the console from the frontend directory.
5. Sign up as a user.  The first sign-in will scrape all the available articles this project analyzes, which will take about a minute.  Subsequent sign-ups and sign-ins will not require further downloading and will be much faster.
6. Log in and explore the site!

* If you don't know this filepath, try /usr/local/var/postgres
